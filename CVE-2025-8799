    In certain constrained or unstable conditions, this log indicates that the AMF asynchronously receives an SBI client event (OGS_EVENT_NAME_SBI_CLIENT) triggered by a Nudm-SDM response after the gNB connection and associated RAN UE context have already been removed (Number of gNBs is now 0). When the AMF then tries to process this event, it fails to find the ran_ue by ID, violating the ran_ue_find_by_id assertion, which leads to a fatal crash. This reflects a typical asynchronous race: a late SBI response arrives after the UE context is cleaned up, and due to missing state validation, the AMF hits an unhandled condition and aborts.
