[CVE ID]
    CVE-2025-8801

[Affected Versions]
    <=v2.7.5

[Description]
    Environment: Latest Open5GS source branch, deployed as Docker containers
    Start all Network Function (NF) containers.
    Apply strict memory constraints to the container or host system.
    Observe the AMF crash during the initialization or registration phase.
    In certain constrained or unstable conditions, This log indicates that the AMF asynchronously receives a smf-select-data response event (OGS_EVENT_NAME_SBI_CLIENT) from nudm-sdm after the UE context has already been removed. Since the UE is in the DEREGISTERED state, the GMM state machine has no valid handling logic for this event, which ultimately triggers a fatal error in gmm_state_exception ("should not be reached"), causing the AMF to crash. This reflects a lack of state validation for delayed SBI responses in the AMF.
