[CVE ID]
    CVE-2025-8800

[Affected Versions]
    <=v2.7.5

[Description]
    1.Setup Open5GS Environment:
        Ensure you are running the latest release of Open5GS and that the environment is properly set up for 4G scenarios. Make sure to configure the MME component as part of the setup.
    2.Use fuzzing tool:
        Use a fuzzing tool to generate and manipulate NAS messages. Focus on modifying the ESM message container in the InitialUEMessage such that the PDN type is set to 0 (unknown).
    3.Send the malformed message:
        Send the modified NAS message (with PDN type = 0) to the MME.
    4.Trigger MME crash:
        The MME should attempt to process the incoming message, but due to the PDN type = 0, it will fail during the session creation, triggering an assertion failure at the following line:
        FATAL: mme_s11_build_create_session_request: Assertion `sess->ue_request_type.type == OGS_NAS_EPS_PDN_TYPE_IPV4 || sess->ue_request_type.type == OGS_NAS_EPS_PDN_TYPE_IPV6 || sess->ue_request_type.type == OGS_NAS_EPS_PDN_TYPE_IPV4V6' failed.
    5.Observe crash:
        The MME process will abort and a core dump will be generated, causing the system to halt.
