[CVE ID]
    CVE-2025-8804

[Affected Versions]
    <=v2.7.5

[Description]
    Environment: Latest Open5GS source branch, deployed as Docker containers
﻿
    Start all Network Function (NF) containers.
﻿
    Apply strict memory constraints to the container or host system（SMF）

    During PDU Session establishment, if the AMF fails to connect to the SMF while attempting to create the SM Context, the AMF proceeds with NAS signaling despite the failure. This leads to an invalid internal state transition and triggers a fatal error in ngap_build_downlink_nas_transport, causing the AMF process to crash.
