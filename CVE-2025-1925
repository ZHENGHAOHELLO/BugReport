[CVE ID]
    CVE-2025-1925

[Affected Versions]
    <=v2.7.2

[Description]
    When a duplicate PDU session establishment is received, the AMF logs a warning and proceeds to update the SM context via the SBI interface. This process eventually calls amf_nsmf_pdusession_build_create_sm_context(), which uses the SUPI to build the SBI URI header. If the SUPI is NULL, then the header's resource component becomes NULL. This leads to a call to ogs_uridup() that asserts on the NULL value, causing a crash.

    This commit adds a check before invoking the SBI update. If the SUPI is NULL, the update is skipped and a warning is logged. This prevents the invalid URI build process and avoids the subsequent crash in ogs_uridup().
