[CVE ID]
    CVE-2025-52288

[Affected Versions]
    <=v2.7.2

[Description]

         In Open5GS v2.7.2, there is a critical crash issue with the UPF (User Plane Function).
    When the PDN type in the PFCP (Packet Forwarding Control Protocol) session establishment request is set to 0, the UPF fails to correctly handle this invalid value.
    This situation may be caused by a misconfiguration in the AMF (Session Management Function) or by a malicious attack.
     Due to the lack of proper validation, the UPF triggers an assertion failure, causing the process to crash.
