[CVE ID]
    CVE-2025-8803

[Affected Versions]
    <=v2.7.5

[Description]
    Steps to reproduce:
    ・Deploy Open5GS with the v2.7.5 source branch, configured as Docker containers.
    ・Apply strict memory constraints to the container or host system to simulate resource limitations.
    ・Observe AMF behavior during mutiple UEs registration.

    The error is encountered by the AMF during its processing of policy control requests, leading the AMF’s GMM (GPRS Mobility Management) state machine to enter an invalid state while attempting to process them. As a result, the system hits a fatal assertion due to improper state transitions, which is explicitly marked as an undefined code path. This issue is further exacerbated in environments with strict memory constraints, where incomplete state handling and resource allocation failures can trigger these state transition errors, ultimately causing the AMF to crash during registration phases.
