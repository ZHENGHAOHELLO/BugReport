[CVE ID]
    CVE-2025-8802

[Affected Versions]
    <=v2.7.5

[Description]
    Environment: Latest Open5GS source branch, deployed as Docker containers

    Start all Network Function (NF) containers.

    Apply strict memory constraints to the container or host system (SMF).

    During PDU Session release, if the SMF is under memory pressure or the HTTP/2 stream is already closed (e.g., due to receiving RST_STREAM), it may still attempt to process the event. This leads to an assertion failure in smf_state_operational, causing the SMF process to crash.

    Instead of safely ignoring or logging the error, the SMF hits a fatal assert(stream) in smf-sm.c, which terminates the entire process, even though the issue may be limited to a single UE's context.
