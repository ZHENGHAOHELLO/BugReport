[CVE ID]
    CVE-2025-9405

[Affected Versions]
    v2.7.5

[Description]
    We deploy the latest Open5GS source branch as Docker containers with strict memory constraints applied to the container or host system. During the UE initialization or registration phase, the AMF may crash due to an invalid state triggered by a late SBI response from nudm-uecm.

    Specifically, when the UE has already been deregistered or removed, the AMF still receives a delayed or asynchronous PUT /nudm-uecm/... response. This SBI_CLIENT response event does not correspond to any valid waiting state in the current GMM state machine.

    The callback is invoked after the UE context has already been released, causing the AMF state machine to process the event in gmm_state_exception(). Since no matching handling logic exists for this state, the AMF encounters an invalid service name [nudm-uecm] and triggers a fatal error.

    As a result, the AMF process terminates abruptly with an assertion failure, leading to service disruption.
